# QRaken

A proof-of-concept .cia QR Code scanner and installer compatible with TLSv1.2.

QRaken provides you the most direct way to download and install .cia QR codes directly from your 3DS. It also has the smoothest QR Code camera you've ever seen to run on a 3DS.

## Usage

Hover the camera on a QR code. Download and installation will be automatic.

Note that TitleDB QR codes aren't known to work with QRaken. It also doesn't work with large .cia files. Its use has been designed to just help users download homebrew in .cia format from Github.

## Building

QRaken for 3DS relies on [latest libctru](https://github.com/smealum/ctrulib), [latest citro3d](https://github.com/fincs/citro3d), [latest citro2d](https://github.com/devkitPro/citro2d) and 3ds-curl with its dependancies.
